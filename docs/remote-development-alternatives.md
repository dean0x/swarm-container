## Migration Paths

### To Oracle Cloud:
```bash
# Provision ARM instance (A1.Flex)
# Install Docker
# Deploy SwarmContainer
# Set up SSH access
# Manual but free forever
```

### To Render:
```bash
# Create render.yaml
# Configure Docker deployment
# Set up SSH keys
# Deploy with auto-sleep
```

### To Railway:
```bash
# railway login
# railway up
# Configure volumes
# No auto-stop (manual management needed)
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Development (intermittent use)**: Render free tier or Fly.io with auto-stop
2. **Always-on development**: Oracle Cloud Always Free
3. **Team collaboration**: Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces
4. **Production-like**: Fly.io or Railway

## Conclusion

While Fly.io is a solid choice with good auto-stop features and reasonable pricing, **Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier** offers unbeatable value for a persistent development environment. The main trade-off is complexity vs cost.

For SwarmContainer's use case:
- **Stay with Fly.io** if you value simplicity and auto-stop
- **Switch to Oracle Cloud** if you want a free, always-on environment
- **Try Render** if you want a generous free tier with auto-sleep

The implementation we've built for Fly.io can be adapted to work with any of these platforms since we're using standard Docker containers and SSH.
