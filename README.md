For detailed version information and update instructions, see [VERSIONS.md](VERSIONS.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Security Level

```bash
# For maximum security (untrusted code)
cp .env.paranoid .env

# For corporate environments
cp .env.enterprise .env

# For local development
cp .env.development .env
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Choose your authentication method:

**Option A: Claude Pro/Max** (use browser login)
```bash
# Leave .env as is - you'll be prompt to login after starting Claude Code
```

**Option B: API Key** (if you have one)
```bash
# Edit .env and add your API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

### 3. Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

Then click "Reopen in Container" when prompted.

**Note:** During container setup, if prompted "Edit shell configs to add deno to the PATH? (Y/n)", enter **Y** (yes). This occurs during MCP server configuration and is required for proper functionality.

### 4. Start Using Claude Flow

Inside the container:
```bash
# Activate Claude Code with full permissions (Required for claude-flow at the moment)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Prompt claude to use claude-flow and 
```

üìö **For detailed security configuration, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**

## Environment Variables

Available environment variables:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your API key (only needed if using API key authentication)
- `SECURITY_PRESET` - Security level: `paranoid`, `enterprise`, or `development` (default)
- `DEVCONTAINER=true` - Automatically set in the container
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Automatically set in the container

## Workspace Structure

The container creates these directories:
- `/workspace` - Your project files

## Security Features

This devcontainer provides comprehensive protection:

### üõ°Ô∏è Two-Layer Security Model

1. **Local Machine Protection**
   - Container runs with restricted privileges
   - Filesystem access limited to workspace
   - No access to host system or personal files
   - Process isolation prevents malware installation

2. **Network Protection**
   - **Container-level firewall rules** (not affecting host)
   - Configurable security presets (never skipped)
   - Domain allowlisting/blocklisting
   - Prevents data exfiltration
   - Protects against supply chain attacks

### üéöÔ∏è Security Presets

Security is **always applied** but with different levels of strictness:

- **Paranoid**: Maximum isolation - explicit allowlist only
- **Enterprise**: Balanced security - common dev services allowed  
- **Development**: Permissive - blocklist for known malicious sites (default)

The firewall runs at container startup with root privileges, ensuring rules cannot be bypassed.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

### Container Build Issues
If the container fails to build:
```bash
# Clean rebuild without cache
docker system prune -a
# Then reopen in VS Code
```

### "iptables: Permission denied" 
This is expected behavior - the container shows this message but continues without network isolation. The security rules are applied at container startup when running with proper privileges. This does not affect functionality.

### "chown: Operation not permitted" on node_modules
This is normal - node_modules is a Docker volume and ownership is managed by Docker. This warning can be ignored.

### Network connectivity issues
Check your security preset:
```bash
echo $SECURITY_PRESET
```
- **Paranoid/Enterprise**: Only allowed domains work. Add custom domains to `.env`:
  ```bash
  CUSTOM_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=api.mycompany.com,npm.mycompany.com
  ```
- **Development**: Most connections allowed, only known malicious sites blocked

### Claude Flow not found
The container installs Claude Flow from source. If it fails:
```bash
# Check installation
which claude-flow

# Reinstall from npm if needed
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha
```

### Updating Claude Flow
To update to the latest version:
```bash
# Update from npm (recommended)
npm update -g claude-flow@alpha

# Or pull latest source for development
cd /workspace/deps/claude-flow
git pull origin main

# Verify update
claude-flow --version
```

### VS Code doesn't show "Reopen in Container"
1. Ensure Remote-Containers extension is installed
2. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
3. Try Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P): "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"

### Deno PATH prompt during setup
If you missed the prompt "Edit shell configs to add deno to the PATH? (Y/n)" during container creation:
- This prompt appears during MCP server configuration
- Answer **Y** (yes) to ensure MCP servers work correctly
- If you accidentally selected 'n', you can manually add Deno to PATH later

## Testing

Run automated tests before opening in VS Code:
```bash
# Run all tests
./test-devcontainer.sh

# Tests check for:
# - Valid JSON configuration
# - Successful container build
# - Proper tool installation
# - Container persistence
# - Security initialization
# - Common configuration errors
```
