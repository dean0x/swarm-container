# Cost estimates (shared CPU, as of 2024):
# - shared-cpu-1x (1 CPU, 256MB): ~$3/month
# - shared-cpu-2x (2 CPU, 512MB): ~$5/month
# - shared-cpu-4x (4 CPU, 1GB): ~$10/month
# - shared-cpu-8x (8 CPU, 2GB): ~$20/month
# 
# With auto-stop enabled, you only pay when the machine is running.
# Storage volumes: $0.15/GB/month
