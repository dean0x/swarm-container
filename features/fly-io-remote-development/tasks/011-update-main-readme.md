# Task 011: Update Main README

## Objective
Update the main README.md to include information about the Fly.io remote development option without overwhelming new users focused on local development.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Task 010 completed: Fly.io documentation created
- [ ] All implementation complete and tested

## Workflow

### 1. Prerequisites Check
- Verify all Fly.io features work
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Review current README structure

### 2. Implementation

#### Step 2.1: Add Remote Development Section
Add after the "Quick Start" section in README.md:

```markdown
## üåê Remote Development Option

Want to access your development environment from anywhere? SwarmContainer now supports deployment to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) for cloud-based development.

### Benefits
- üåç **Access from anywhere** - Work from any device with SSH
- üí™ **Scalable resources** - Need more power? Scale up instantly  
- üë• **Team collaboration** - Share environments with your team
- üí∞ **Cost effective** - Pay only for what you use (~$5-20/month)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Set up in under 5 minutes
flyctl auth login
./scripts/fly-volume-setup.sh
./scripts/fly-ssh-setup.sh  
flyctl deploy
```

**[Full Fly.io Setup Guide ‚Üí](docs/fly-io-setup.md)**

> **Note**: Remote development is completely optional. All existing local features work exactly as before.
```

#### Step 2.2: Update Feature List
In the main features section, add:

```markdown
### ‚ú® Highlights

- **üõ°Ô∏è Isolated Security** - Container-level firewall and network isolation keeps your host system safe while working with AI
- **üß† Dynamic Memory Allocation** - Automatically sets Node.js heap to 75% of container memory, prevents OOM errors across all security presets
- **‚ö° Zero-Latency MCP** - Local MCP servers for enhanced Claude Code capabilities
- **üîß Auto-Updating MCP Config** - Live configuration updates with file watcher - modify `.mcp.config` and changes apply instantly
- **üì¶ Smart Fallbacks** - Multiple installation strategies ensure everything works on your machine (ARM, x86, Mac, Linux)
- **üß™ Battle-Tested** - Comprehensive test suite validates your setup before you even start coding
- **üåê Cloud Ready** - Optional deployment to Fly.io for remote development from anywhere
```

#### Step 2.3: Add to Table of Contents
Update the README table of contents:

```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [Remote Development Option](#-remote-development-option)
- [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)
- [Security Features](#security-features)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Resources](#resources)
```

#### Step 2.4: Update Workspace Structure
Add note about cloud deployment:

```markdown
## Workspace Structure

When you open your project in the container:
- `/workspace` - Your project root (mounted from your local machine)

**For cloud deployment**: The same structure is maintained with persistent volumes. See [Fly.io Setup Guide](docs/fly-io-setup.md) for details.
```

#### Step 2.5: Add to Resources Section
```markdown
## Resources

- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [VS Code DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [Fly.io Remote Development Guide](docs/fly-io-setup.md)
- [Development Team Agents Guide](docs/development-team-agents-guide.md)
```

### 3. Testing

#### Test 3.1: README Flow
- Read through updated README
- Ensure local users aren't confused
- Verify remote option is clear but not intrusive

#### Test 3.2: Link Verification
```bash
# Check all documentation links work
grep -h "\[.*\](.*)" README.md | grep -o "(.*)" | tr -d "()" | while read link; do
  if [[ $link == http* ]]; then
    echo "External: $link"
  else
    [ -f "$link" ] && echo "‚úì $link" || echo "‚úó $link"
  fi
done
```

### 4. Documentation

Ensure README maintains:
- Local-first approach
- Clear that remote is optional
- Easy to understand for new users
- Professional appearance

### 5. Completion Criteria
- [ ] Remote development section added
- [ ] Features list updated
- [ ] Table of contents updated
- [ ] Links all working
- [ ] Flow makes sense for new users
- [ ] Optional nature is clear

## Key Messages

### Positioning
1. **Local First**: Default experience unchanged
2. **Optional Enhancement**: Cloud is an add-on
3. **Easy Migration**: Can move between local/cloud
4. **Same Experience**: Features work identically

### Tone
- Exciting but not overwhelming
- Clear about optional nature
- Focus on benefits
- Link to detailed guides

## README Balance

### What to Include
- Brief overview of remote option
