# Development environment configuration
# This is the default preset - good for local development

SECURITY_PRESET=development
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
# CUSTOM_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=api.mycompany.com,npm.mycompany.com

# Multi-instance configuration
# Default: 6 instances (5GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 74% heap)
# CLAUDE_CODE_INSTANCES=6      # Number of Claude Code instances to run

# Resources are automatically calculated based on instance count:
#   1 instance:   3GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 75% heap  (light usage)
#   6 instances:  5GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 74% heap  (default - moderate usage)
#   10 instances: 8GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 70% heap  (heavy usage)
#   25 instances: 17GB RAM, 8 CPUs, 55% heap (power user)
#   50 instances: 32GB RAM, 16 CPUs, 40% heap (workstation)

# To customize: set CLAUDE_CODE_INSTANCES and rebuild container
# Or run: ./scripts/configure-for-instances.sh
